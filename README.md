# Fate-Wielding-Bot

<p> So long story short: We are a group of friends studying Software Engineering and we decided to do something during the lock down... </p>
<p> So we created this bot, to <strong>troll</strong>  each other.</p>

We are still woking in the bot, so it might have some **bugs**, we apologize for that...
If you have any ideia on how to improve the bot, or any command you'd like to see added, just send us a message :) .

## Commands
<p> For now we only have a hand full of working commands:</p>

- `!fate about` This command is pretty self-explanatory.
- `!fate choose` This Will chooose one between all arguments given.
- `!fate choose+` Similar to the choose command, but will choose more than one arg.
- `!fate nuke` This is a fun one, so basically the bot will enter the voice channel you are in and disconnect a random number of users.
- `!fate pussy` Just try it out ;). 
- `!fate roulette` Our favorite, and the first command we added. This command will kick a random user from your voice channel Russian Rollete style.
- `!fate duel @user` You will duel with the user you identify. Old West Style. -Beta
- `!fate cry` Just tilt your friends when they throw a tantrum
- `!fate yeahboi` YEAHBOIIIIIIIII
- `!fate silence` You better be muted for this one
- `!fate mute` Mutes everyone on the voice channel
- `!fate unmute` UnMutes everyone on the voice channel
- `!fate say` Will enter your channel and say anything you want him to say.Check out the available languages [here](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#localized-accents).
